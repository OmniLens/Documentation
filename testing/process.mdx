## Local Testing

OmniLens has commands to make it easy to run specific test suites:
```bash
bun run test:health
```

You can also run the tests directly:
```bash
bun tests/health.test.js
```

## GitHub Actions

OmniLens has GitHub Actions configured to run our test suites:

- When a pull request is opened
- On every push to a pull request
- When code is merged to main

You can also trigger these workflows manually via their Workflow Dispatch options and have them run on a specified branch.
